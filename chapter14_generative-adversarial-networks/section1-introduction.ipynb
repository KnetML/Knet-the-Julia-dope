    "# Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout most of this book, we've talked about how to make predictions.\n",
    "In some form or another, we used deep neural networks learned mappings from data points to labels.\n",
    "This kind of learning is called discriminative learning,\n",
    "as in, we'd like to be able to discriminate between photos cats and photos of dogs. \n",
    "Classifiers and regressors are both examples of discriminative learning. \n",
    "And neural networks trained by backpropagation \n",
    "have upended everything we thought we knew about discriminative learning \n",
    "on large complicated datasets. \n",
    "Classification accuracies on high-res images has gone from useless \n",
    "to human-level (with some caveats) in just 5-6 years. \n",
    "We'll spare you another spiel about all the other discriminative tasks \n",
    "where deep neural networks do astoundingly well.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's more to machine learning than just solving discriminative tasks.\n",
    "For example, given a large dataset, without any labels,\n",
    "we might want to learn a model that concisely captures the characteristics of this data.\n",
    "Given such a model, we could sample synthetic data points that resemble the distribution of the training data.\n",
    "For example, given a large corpus of photographs of faces,\n",
    "we might want to be able to generate a *new* photorealistic image \n",
    "that looks like it might plausibly have come from the same dataset. \n",
    "This kind of learning is called *generative modeling*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently, we had no method that could synthesize novel photorealistic images. \n",
    "But the success of deep neural networks for discriminative learning opened up new possiblities.\n",
    "One big trend over the last three years has been the application of discriminative deep nets\n",
    "to overcome challenges in problems that we don't generally think of as supervised learning problems.\n",
    "The recurrent neural network language models are one example of using a discriminative network (trained to predict the next character)\n",
    "that once trained can act as a generative model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, a young researcher named Ian Goodfellow introduced [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) a clever new way to leverage the power of discriminative models to get good generative models. \n",
    "GANs made quite a splash so it's quite likely you've seen the images before. \n",
    "For instance, using a GAN you can create fake images of bedrooms, as done by [Radford et al. in 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) and depicted below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/fake_bedrooms.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At their heart, GANs rely on the idea that a data generator is good\n",
    "if we cannot tell fake data apart from real data. \n",
    "In statistics, this is called a two-sample test - a test to answer the question whether datasets $X = \\{x_1, \\ldots x_n\\}$ and $X' = \\{x_1', \\ldots x_n'\\}$ were drawn from the same distribution. \n",
    "The main difference between most statistics papers and GANs  is that the latter use this idea in a constructive way.\n",
    "In other words, rather than just training a model to say 'hey, these two datasets don't look like they came from the same distribution', they use the two-sample test to provide training signal to a generative model.\n",
    "This allows us to improve the data generator until it generates something that resembles the real data. \n",
    "At the very least, it needs to fool the classifier. And if our classifier is a state of the art deep neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are two pieces to GANs - first off, we need a device (say, a deep network but it really could be anything, such as a game rendering engine) that might potentially be able to generate data that looks just like the real thing. \n",
    "If we are dealing with images, this needs to generate images. \n",
    "If we're dealing with speech, it needs to generate audio sequences, and so on. \n",
    "We call this the *generator network*. The second component is the *discriminator network*. \n",
    "It attempts to distinguish fake and real data from each other. \n",
    "Both networks are in competition with each other. \n",
    "The generator network attempts to fool the discriminator network. At that point, the discriminator network adapts to the new fake data. This information, in turn is used to improve the generator network, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Generator**\n",
    "* Draw some parameter $z$ from a source of randomness, e.g. a normal distribution $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n",
    "* Apply a function $f$ such that we get $x' = G(u,w)$\n",
    "* Compute the gradient with respect to $w$ to minimize $\\log p(y = \\mathrm{fake}|x')$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Discriminator**\n",
    "* Improve the accuracy of a binary classifier $f$, i.e. maximize $\\log p(y=\\mathrm{fake}|x')$ and $\\log p(y=\\mathrm{true}|x)$ for fake and real data respectively.\n",

    "In short, there are two optimization problems running simultaneously, and the optimization terminates if a stalemate has been reached. There are lots of further tricks and details on how to modify this basic setting. For instance, we could try solving this problem in the presence of side information. This leads to cGAN, i.e. conditional Generative Adversarial Networks. We can change the way how we detect whether real and fake data look the same. This leads to wGAN (Wasserstein GAN), kernel-inspired GANs and lots of other settings, or we could change how closely we look at the objects. E.g. fake images might look real at the texture level but not so at the larger level, or vice versa. "
