    "One of the appeals of RNNs is the idea that they might be able to connect previous information to the present task, such as using previous video frames might inform the understanding of the present frame. If RNNs could do this, they’d be extremely useful. But can they? It depends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we only need to look at recent information to perform the present task. For example, consider a language model trying to predict the next word based on the previous ones. If we are trying to predict the last word in “the clouds are in the sky,” we don’t need any further context – it’s pretty obvious the next word is going to be sky. In such cases, where the gap between the relevant information and the place that it’s needed is small, RNNs can learn to use the past information.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are also cases where we need more context. Consider trying to predict the last word in the text “I grew up in France… I speak fluent French.” Recent information suggests that the next word is probably the name of a language, but if we want to narrow down which language, we need the context of France, from further back. It’s entirely possible for the gap between the relevant information and the point where it is needed to become very large. Unfortunately, as that gap grows, RNNs become unable to learn to connect the information.\n",

Gates are a way to optionally let information through. They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net layer and a pointwise multiplication operation (first, second, and fourth learned layers). The sigmoid layer outputs numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component should be let through. A value of zero means “let nothing through,” while a value of one means “let everything through!”\n",

Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values (denoted by $C$), $\\tilde{C}_t$, that could be added to the state.

    "In mathematics, an [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding) is one instance of some mathematical structure contained within another instance, such as a group that is a subgroup. When some object $X$ is said to be embedded in another object $Y$, the embedding is given by some *injective* and *structure-preserving* map $f : X \\rightarrow Y$. The precise meaning of \"structure-preserving\" depends on the kind of mathematical structure of which $X$ and $Y$ are instances. In the terminology of category theory, a structure-preserving map is called a morphism. The fact that a map $f : X \\rightarrow Y$ is an embedding is often indicated by the use of a \"hooked arrow\": $f:X\\hookrightarrow Y$. \n",

For example, suppose that we are given the task of determining the likelihood that a given document was plagiarized. That means that we need to compare this document to multiple to others and determine how *related* or equal the documents are. One scheme could involve comparing the words found on each document. We can represent a word as a vector of numbers:\n",

However, *the notion of relatedness* depends on what vector representation you have chosen for words. For example, is Seattle similar to Denver because they are both cities? What about Seattle and Seahawks? In addition, these vectors often tend to be very high-dimensional (thousands, or even millions) and sparse. Thus, we must turn to \"learning\" a particular lower-dimensional dense embedding (or vector) for our task. You can learn more about embeddings [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/182775/what-is-an-embedding-layer-in-a-neural-network) or [here](https://www.slideshare.net/BhaskarMitra3/a-simple-introduction-to-word-embeddings).\n",

The idea is that since our vocabulary is discrete, we will learn a map, $emb$, which will embed each character into a continuous vector space $X$. Using this vector space representation will allow us to have a continuous, distributed representation of our vocabulary characters. If for example the lenght of our vocabulary is $V$, we may now use our continuous character features to create a distributed representation of our $V$ characters.  In the process of training a language model we will learn this character embedding map $emb:voca\\hookrightarrow X$. The hope is that by using a continuous representation, our embedding will map similar words to similar regions.\n",
